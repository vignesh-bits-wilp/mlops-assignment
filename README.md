```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up DVC (if using data version control):
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Development

- Add your source code in the `src/` directory
- Place raw data files in `data/raw/`
- Processed data goes in `data/processed/`
- Use notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploration
- Write tests in the `tests/` directory
- Store trained models in `models/`

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Write tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
